## 🐍 Basics of Python

Python is a **high-level, general-purpose programming language**.  
It is **open-source** and **platform-independent**, meaning Python programs can run on **Windows, macOS, and Linux** without modification.

Python is known for its **simple syntax, readability, and ease of learning**, making it one of the most popular programming languages today.

### 📌 What Is Indentation?

Indentation refers to the **spaces at the beginning of a line of code**.

✔ Indentation is **mandatory in Python**  
✔ Standard indentation is **4 spaces**  
✔ All statements inside a block must have the **same indentation level**

### 🟢 Example: Correct Indentation

```python
if True:
    print("This line is inside the if block")
    print("Python uses indentation")

print("This line is outside the if block")

In the above example:

The first two print statements belong to the if block
The last print statement is outside the block

### 🔴 Example: Incorrect Indentation
if True:
print("This will cause an error")

❌ This code will raise an IndentationError because the print statement is not properly indented.

## 💬 Comments in Python

Comments are **non-executable lines of code**.  
Python **ignores comments during runtime**, so they do not affect program execution.

Comments are mainly used to:
- Explain the code  
- Improve readability  
- Temporarily disable code during testing or debugging  

### 🟢 Single-Line Comment

Single-line comments start with the `#` symbol.

```python
# This is a single-line comment
print("Welcome to Python!")

eg: print("Welcome to Python!")  # Prints a greeting message

### 🟢 Multi-Line Comment (Common Practice)

Python does not have a dedicated multi-line comment syntax.
However, triple quotes are commonly used to write multi-line comments or documentation.

**Using single quotes ('''):**

'''
This is a multi-line comment
Python will ignore this during execution
'''
print("Welcome to Python!")

**Using double quotes ("""):**

"""
This is another example
of a multi-line comment
"""
print("Welcome to Python!")
